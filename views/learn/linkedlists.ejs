            <h2>Introduction to Linked Lists</h2>
            <p>Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. They provide a flexible way to store and manipulate collections of data.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Use Linked Lists?</h2>
            <p>Linked lists offer several advantages, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic size, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.</li>
                <li>No need for contiguous memory allocation.</li>
                <li>Efficient insertion and deletion at the beginning and end of the list.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Operations</h2>
            <p>Common operations on linked lists include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inserting elements at the beginning, end, or middle.</li>
                <li>Deleting elements from the beginning, end, or middle.</li>
                <li>Searching for elements in the list.</li>
                <li>Reversing the linked list.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Types of Linked Lists</h2>
            <p>There are several types of linked lists, each with its own characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to null.</li>
                <li>Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.</li>
                <li>Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.</li>
            </ul>
