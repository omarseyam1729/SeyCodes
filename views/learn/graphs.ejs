            <h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>
            <p>Graphs are data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. They are used to model relationships between entities and have numerous applications in computer science, including networking, social media, and search engines.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Use Graphs?</h2>
            <p>Graphs are useful because they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Model complex relationships naturally.</li>
                <li>Support various algorithms for traversal, searching, and pathfinding.</li>
                <li>Handle both directed and undirected relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Operations</h2>
            <p>Common operations on graphs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traversing the graph (BFS, DFS).</li>
                <li>Finding the shortest path between nodes (Dijkstra's, A*).</li>
                <li>Detecting cycles and connectivity.</li>
                <li>Finding minimum spanning trees (Kruskal's, Prim's).</li>
            </ul>
