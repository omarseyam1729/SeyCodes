            <h2>Introduction to Trees</h2>
            <p>Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node and child nodes, forming a parent-child relationship. Trees are widely used in various applications, including databases and file systems.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Use Trees?</h2>
            <p>Trees are beneficial because they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Represent hierarchical relationships naturally.</li>
                <li>Provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.</li>
                <li>Support balanced structures like AVL and Red-Black trees for improved performance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Operations</h2>
            <p>Common operations on trees include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traversing the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order).</li>
                <li>Searching for elements.</li>
                <li>Inserting and deleting nodes.</li>
                <li>Finding the height and depth of the tree.</li>
            </ul>
